        <div>With the increasing use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in military and civilian applications, the security of this
              technology has become one of the critical concerns. UAVs’ positioning and navigation activities are highly dependent on Global
              Positioning Systems as they provide accurate locations for these
              vehicles. However, due to the civilian GPS signals being open
              and unencrypted, malicious users can target them in multiple
              ways, including by launching Global Positioning System spoofing
              attacks. To address this security issue, numerous techniques
              have been proposed to detect and classify these attacks,including
              supervised machine learning techniques. However, no studies
              have focused on unsupervised models to detect these attacks. In
              this paper, we compare the performance of several supervised
              models with that of unsupervised models in terms of accuracy,
              probability of detection, probability of misdetection, probability
              of false alarm, processing time, training time, prediction time,
              and memory size. The supervised models are Gaussian Naïve
              Bayes, Classification and Regression Decision Tree, Logistic
              Regression, Random Forest, Linear-Support Vector Machine,
              and Artificial Neural Network. The unsupervised models are
              Principal Component Analysis, K-means clustering, and Autoencoder. The results show that the Classification and Regression
              Decision Tree model outperforms the other supervised and
              unsupervised models in detecting and classifying GPS spoofing
attacks.
