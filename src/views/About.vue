         Hello! I'm a software engineer with practical experience developing applications using JavaScript and Python.
        I'm a passionate, driven, and quick life-long learner dedicated to providing solutions through problem solving and troubleshooting.
        I am a creative soul who loves brainstorming solutions â€“ be it with a computer or a client.
        I love all aspects of software development from full-stack development to data science.
        Although I enjoy experimenting with different technology and building side-projects,
        I excel in a collaborative team-based environment with a variety of differing perspectives.
        I have successfully built clean, scalable, and dynamic front-end web applications with TypeScript and Angular.
        Using Python I have developed Flask-based web applications and machine learning techniques for
        cybersecurity threat detection using neural networks.
        Some of my skills include:
