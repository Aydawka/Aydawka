# About me

I'm a software engineer with practical experience developing applications using JavaScript and Python. I'm a passionate, driven, and quick life-long learner dedicated to providing solutions through problem solving and troubleshooting. I am a creative soul who loves brainstorming solutions â€“ be it with a computer or a client.

I love all aspects of software development from full-stack development to data science. Although I enjoy experimenting with different technology and building side-projects, I excel in a collaborative team-based environment with a variety of differing perspectives.
